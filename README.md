  <h1>C to Python Calculator Compiler</h1>
  <p>This project is a C to Python compiler that generates code for a simple calculator. The compiler takes C source code as input and generates Python source code as output that performs the same calculations as the original C code.</p>
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Translates C source code into Python source code for a calculator</li>
    <li>Supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)</li>
    <li>Generates readable and well-structured Python code</li>
    <li>Handles input validation to prevent errors during execution</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>To use the compiler, simply run the following command:</p>
  <pre>c2py &lt;input_file.c&gt; &lt;output_file.py&gt;</pre>
  <p>This command will read the input file, parse the arithmetic expressions, and generate Python code that performs the same calculations. The resulting Python code will be written to the output file.</p>
  <h2>Supported Syntax</h2>
  <p>The calculator compiler supports a subset of the C language syntax that includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Variable declarations and assignments</li>
    <li>Arithmetic and logical operators</li>
    <li>Control structures (if/else, while, for)</li>
    <li>Functions and function calls</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <p>The calculator compiler has several limitations, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Limited support for C language syntax (not all features are supported)</li>
    <li>Limited support for complex arithmetic expressions</li>
    <li>Does not support external libraries or system calls</li>
    <li>Performance may be slower than native C code</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  <p>The calculator compiler could be extended in the future to support more complex arithmetic expressions, such as trigonometric functions or complex numbers. Additionally, the compiler could be optimized for performance to generate Python code that is faster and more efficient.</p>
